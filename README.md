# Koa User Api Example.

Koa v2 user api example.

Start server with `PORT=3001 npm run start` (Make sure you have `mongod`
running) 

Start tests with `npm run test:watch` and try to hit "save" on any file
_server index, routes, models or even test itself_ will give the error i'm
facing port 3000 is already inuse.

I need some help with this project i think i'm missing something while
exporting app so it can run smoothly with my tests.

Thank you.
