# Koa User Api Example.

Koa v2 user api.

##Contains

    - koa-rest-router.
    - koa-better-body.
    - passport-jwt & passport-local Authentication.
    - jwt-local creating my jwts.
    - mongoose.
    - async/awaits *If i should even mention this*.

###Starting up.

Run your `mongod` service. 

Start running `npm install` to install packages then on some other window

type `npm run watch` which will start compiling and watching es6 files.

Start server with `npm run start` *This should be second because, it serves
files from `/dist/src/server` and they need the babel compilation above.

Run tests with `npm run test` or watch them as you code with
`npm run test:watch`.

Contribution welcome!
